A Java file may contain atmost one public class only. And, if the file has a public class defined, the name of the class and the Java file it's contained within must share the same name.
A Java file may contain any number of classes, given not more than one is defined as public. After compilation, each class get it's individual ".class" file generated.
While declaraing explicit imports as "import java.util.* ", only the classes within that package are available to the declared class. Sub-packages have to imported explicitly.
